31/01/2022, 12:31 pm - Vamshi Sir Av Clg: 🏃🏽‍♂️

I was jogging this morning and I noticed a person about half a km ahead. 

I could guess he was running a little slower than me and that made me feel good, I said to myself I will try catch up with him.

So I started running faster and faster. Every block, I was gaining on him a little bit. 

After just a few minutes I was only about 100 feet behind him, so I really picked up the pace and pushed myself. I was determined to catch up with him.

Finally, I did it! I caught up and passed him. Inwardly I felt very good. "I beat him". 

Of course, he didn't even know we were racing. 

After I passed him, I realized I had been so focused on competing against him that .....

I had missed my turn to my house,

I had missed the focus on my inner peace,

I missed to see the beauty of greenery around, 

I missed to do my inner soul searching meditation, 

It then dawned on me, isn't that what happens in life when we focus on competing with co-workers, neighbours, friends,  family, trying to outdo them or trying to prove that we are more successful or more important and in the bargain we miss on our happiness within our own surroundings?

The problem with unhealthy competition is that it's a never ending cycle.

There will always be somebody ahead of you, someone with a better job, nicer car, more money in the bank, more education, a prettier wife, a more handsome husband, better behaved children, better circumstances and better conditions etc.
 
But one important realisation is that You can be the best that you can be, when you are not competing with anyone.

Some people are insecure because they pay too much attention to what others are, where others are going, wearing and driving, what others are talking.  

Accept it and realize, that you are blessed. Stay focused and live a healthy life. 

There is no competition in Destiny. Each has his own.

Comparison AND Competition  is the thief of JOY. It kills the Joy of Living your Own Life.

Run your own Race that leads to a Peaceful, Happy, Steady Life. 

🙏 Have a good day 🙏
